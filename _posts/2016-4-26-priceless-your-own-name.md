Have you ever wanted to secure your very own personal or brand email address? Like, why can't I be edbyrne@gmail.com (NOT my real email address!) instead of edbyrne999@gmail.com (also NOT my real email address)?

I've tried but I've always been unsuccessful. That's usually because I'm such a late adopter to these types of new services. I do kick myself at times, as it's an opportunity that if grabbed, can offer you great personalisation in both your professional profile and online communications.

But it's not just the professional benefits of a personal or unique email address. People have made a fortune out of the acquiring sought after email addresses, domain names or twitter handles: Referred to as “email flipping” or in the case of websites “domain flipping”. I definitely don’t promote the monetization of acquiring email addresses, but wouldn't it just be nice, for once, to be able to get your own name, or the name of your favourite band, celebrity without a string of mad numbers after it?

That said, this type of opportunity has a timeframe. Email addresses by their nature, are allocated to users on a first come first served basis. One of the great benefits for early adopters of <a href='https://www.topmail.com'>Topmail</a> as a service, is that you NOW have the chance to grab your own 100% private and personalised email address before the rest of the crowd follow suit.
