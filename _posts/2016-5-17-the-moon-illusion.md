excerpt: "Everyone in business sooner or later realizes that their Profit & Loss is not as important as their Cashflow. You can make all the profit you want, but it won’t amount to anything if you can’t pay your bills as they come due."

Anyone who’s taken a picture of the Moon knows that the way we see it is an illusion. I first realized this trying to take a photo of an enormous, beautiful Moon rising over the ruins of a Franciscan chapel on Mt Precipice in Nazareth. What I got was a small, smudgy circle of light.

As it turns out visual proximity to the Horizon, makes the Moon look much bigger. A picture illustrates this quite simply:

There’s another very similar illusion that is easier to experience on a screen, called the Ponzo illusion:

Both the orange lines are identical in length. You can measure them to be sure. If you have a ruler handy. Or you could trust me.

When we’re confronted with illusions of this kind, we instinctively don’t want to believe we could have got it so wrong. After all, if we can’t trust our eyes and ears, what can we rely on?

It’s easy to understand this simple visual illusion. Once we know about it, it causes us no surprise. It’s harder to accept that we’re deceiving ourselves about things we do every day, things we do professionally and take pride in. But human nature doesn’t change just because we put on a suit.

Which brings me to the point: Money. Everyone in business sooner or later realizes that their Profit & Loss is not as important as their Cashflow. You can make all the profit you want, but it won’t amount to anything if you can’t pay your bills as they come due. Likewise, if you’re shipping big losses but you’re able to meet your obligations, then you live to make profits another day. So when you hear about General Motors making a $38bn dollar loss in a single year (2007) and wonder how a company that’s valued at $50bn can sustain something like that: it’s down to cashflow.

Every business is going to be in one of two modes: Survival or Growth (if you’re not in either then you have to ask yourself why you got out of bed this morning). Both of these situations require strict management of cashflow. In both scenarios people look to debt and to equity, because they’re the easiest buttons to push. Cashflow management is hard work, but it’s also the cheapest source of funding you can get. And whether you’re growing, or just surviving, the cheapest money is the best money. Good cashflow management is as real and solid as any asset — it’s money in the bank.
What has any of this got to do with illusions? Well the greatest challenge to good cashflow management is human psychology. We are naturally biased about money and we bring these biases into work with us. Some of us are too optimistic (many business owners are in this category) and some of us are too pessimistic.

Excessive optimism means persistently overestimating how much will come in and underestimating how much will be paid out. That means you pay others too early, don’t pursue payments due with sufficient energy and generally ignore or debate any data which suggests you have a problem. Debatable data in particular is the easiest “out” for any intelligent optimist: “Oh well what you didn’t know is we’ve got this great new product that’s launching next week, so that will probably change those figures completely.” Probably. (In fact I’m the master of the optimistic hand-waving strategy, especially at home, which is one of the reasons I was attracted to Spondool in the first place. I wanted to change that behavior).

Excessive pessimism means projecting negatively into the future. While a pessimist will probably have good cashflow management skills, they won’t keep an accurate picture of what their future position is going to be. That encourages excessive risk aversion: under investment, scaling back when you should be scaling up, firing when you ought to be hiring —

In case all this sounds like very obvious stuff, let me confess that I ran a profitable business for more than ten years without ever really getting to grips with persistently negative cashflow. That wasn’t because I didn’t understand the problem. I did. But I didn’t take steps to change the underlying mental habits which caused it in the first place. Understanding is easy, change is hard. Habit will overpower intelligence every time.

So what’s important is to have some way of bringing your perceptions into line with reality. Try to make yourself see that those two orange lines are the same length. Like everything habitual, that means doing something every day. It means engaging with the actual figures every day. It means pitting your expectations against reality every day.

That’s what I’m hoping to help people with businesses to do with Spondool. Starting today.
