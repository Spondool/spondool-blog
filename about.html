Spondool is a SaaS business based in Dublin, Ireland.
</p>	
<p>	Spondool makes software that helps companies change their cashflow management culture, so they can develop positive cashflow and grow their business.
</p><p>
Spondool has a unique, contrarian approach to the software business. We believe in helping human beings actively collaborate. We discourage excessive automation, which can lead to a lack of clear responsibility and which can conceal important information. We view the software as the tool, not the user.
</p><p>
	Spondool is a process, a way of managing information about cash that gets you the realtime data you want. No percentages, no actuarial gobbledygook, no guesses: just cold, hard numbers.
